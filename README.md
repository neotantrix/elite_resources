How to Use


BindingsNew.rar

The bindingsnew.rar is my entire set of keybinds, simply unzip it in you elite appdata directory. 
usually found at: C:\Users\\<username>\AppData\Local\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\Options\Bindings


PipMacroQwerty6.ahk

This is a script to be ran with the program autohotkey found here: https://www.autohotkey.com/
Once downloaded just run the script and it will bind 1-6 above your QWERTY to six useful pip macros.


alert_new_ip.py

This is a python script that will play a sound anytime a new ip connects to the port you designate in the script, and does this
without logging any ip's. It simply stores them in ram for 300 seconds and they are discarded after. setting up this one is a bit more complicated. 
It requires a python environment be present and the python install must also include scapy and playsound. 
Once you have your python environment setup just run 'pip install scapy playsound' inside the python environment. 
Also, it requires port forwarding be setup on your router, and by default sniffs port 5100 - but that can be edited to whatever you want (Line 48). 
Line 9 requires you to point it to and mp3 you'd like played when a new IP is detected (remember to use backslash for python)


NohBoardOverlay.rar

This is my custom overlay for the app found here:  https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard/releases
Unzip the file to whatever directory you set your nohboard install too, and that's it, should be ready to go.
